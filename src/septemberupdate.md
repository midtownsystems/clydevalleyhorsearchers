So, a busy month with three sessions! 5 new archers introduced to the sport and 5 returning archers practicing their skills. 

Our October session has already sold out with three new archers coming and 6 regulars attending.  We now have 11 members (which is pretty good going in two months I think).  Some of us had a try at this months BHAA postal match which was set by myself (not sure why I made it so hard!) and did so well on only their second or third session.  Also some ⭐️ horses who took this new sport in their stride.

Only one session in October unfortunately as I have other commitments and it’s fully booked but we still have some availability in November. 

We also have a Christmas ground shoot on the 17th of December which will include fun shooting games and mini competitions. 

Over the winter I am planning a number of ground shoots which will include training up for  the Club Archer qualification and games to help archers monitor their progress. 

We now have a calendar on the website so please check back for further dates which will be announced soon.
