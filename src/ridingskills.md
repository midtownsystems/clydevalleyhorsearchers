Thereâ€™s a lot more to mounted archery than just shooting the bow.  A secure shooting position off the saddle is needed, you learn to ride and steer without reins and your horse/pony is desensitised to the sounds or archery in a progressive way - and this includes the rider holding different riding positions for the different types of shots. 

This is great for building riding confidence and a partnership with your mount. As a BHSAI I can teach these skills as well as assess Club members riding and equine care knowledge for the BHAA qualifications.
